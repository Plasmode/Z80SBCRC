# Z80SBCRC Single board 20MHz Z80 for RC2014
## Introduction
The original intent of Z80SBCRC is to design a very simple single-board Z80 computer to check out the handful of 20MHz Z80 chips I purchased off eBay.  The design built on a Prototype for RC2014 board (https://github.com/Plasmode/ProtoRC) and added Z80 and SRAM and later a compact flash drive.  All the logic are inside the existing EPM7128 CPLD on the prototype board.
